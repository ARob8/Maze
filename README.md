# Maze

## Overview

This C++ project demonstrates practical applications of data structures and algorithms, focusing on maze generation and solution. The program reads maze descriptions from a 2-dimensional array in a file, generates the maze, and then finds a solution, outputting it to another file.

## Features
- Maze Generation: The program generates mazes based on input from a file.
- Maze Solving: Utilizes various algorithms such as Backtracking, Depth-First Search (DFS), and Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find solutions efficiently.
- Data Structures: Implements essential data structures including Stacks, Queues, Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, and Graphs. 
- Sorting Algorithms: Demonstrates Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Insertion Sort for various functionalities within the program.

## Purpose
This project serves as a comprehensive exercise in applying data structures and algorithms to solve real-world problems. By demonstrating proficiency in implementing these concepts, it showcases their versatility and effectiveness in maze generation and solution.

## Usage
1. Input your maze description into a file.
2. Run the program, providing the input file.
3. The program will generate the maze and find a solution, writing the output, including the maze solution to a file.
